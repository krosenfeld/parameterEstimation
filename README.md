# Parameter estimation and model choice

As data volumes are growing, and the need for recognizing emergent structures efficiently is becoming more pressing, methods from Data Science such as unsupervised learning are in demand.

Using unsupervised learning can be an incredibly powerful tool, but should be applied with care. This tutorial uses k-means as a machine learning method to demonstrate the importance of critical model evaluation.

The tutorial accompanies lecture material, and the intended learning outcome is to enable optimal parameter selection.
