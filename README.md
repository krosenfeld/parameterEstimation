# Parameter estimation and model choice

As data volumes are growing, and the need for recognizing emergent structures efficiently is becoming more pressing, methods from Data Science such as unsupervised learning present an increasingly important tool.

Using unsupervised learning can be an incredibly powerful tool, but should be applied with care. This tutorial uses k-means as a machine learning method to demonstrate the importance of critical model evaluation.

The tutorial accompanies lecture material, and the intended learning outcome is to enable optimal parameter selection.


### To launch the Binder and interactively play with the material:

Click the "Launch Binder" button below and wait while the repository starts. 

What we will have done is create an online environment where you can execute code by pressing "shift+return" in one of the cells with code. If on a phone, pless the "play" button next to the code cell.
